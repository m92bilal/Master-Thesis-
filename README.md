# Master-Thesis-
Creating a python tool in Reddit that scrapes data through posts in subreddits including r/news, r/investing, r/wallstreetbets etc. The data should comb over the post titles as well as comments.
The idea is to detect for 'talk' on potential mergers or aquisitions between companies. This can be achieved by subscribing to hit words such as the name of the companies combined with the words 'merger' and/or 'aquisition'. 
The amount of hits for each of the companies in the S4 database can then be ranked.
